# MCP Theory 
 The Model Context Protocol is a framework for enabling communication and collaboration between multiple machine learning models or AI systems. It provides a standardised way for models to :
 1. Share the context : Exchange data, metadata and intermediate results
 2. Collaborate : Work together to solve complex tasks
 3. Interpolate : Allow models built with different frameworks or technologies to communicate seamlessly.

 In short, MCP acts as a language or protocol that models use to talk to each other.

# MCP Demo: Model Context Protocol

This is a simple demo of the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** using Python. 
It simulates how two models (a preprocessing model and a prediction model) can communicate 
using JSON-based MCP messages.

## mcp-demo
### models
#### model_a.py - Preprocessing model
This script pre-processes the input data and generates an MCP message.
#### model_b.py - Prediction model
This script reads the MCP message from the data/mcp_message.json and makes the prediction.
### data
#### mcp_message.json - MCP message file (generated by model_a.py)
A json file is created with the preprocessed data and metadata.

# How to run this 
Follow these steps to set up and run the MCP demo project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x**: Make sure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
- **Git**: Install Git to clone the repository. Download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following command to clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SwetaAIS2024/mcp-demo-ref.git
   ```
3. Navigate into the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd mcp-demo-ref
   ```

### Step 2: Set Up the Project
1. Check if Python is installed:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```
2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment to isolate dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - On macOS/Linux:
       ```bash
       source venv/bin/activate
       ```
     - On Windows:
       ```bash
       venv\Scripts\activate
       ```

### Step 3: Run the Models
1. **Run `model_a.py`**:
   - This script preprocesses the input data and generates an MCP message.
   - Run it using:
     ```bash
     python models/model_a.py
     ```
   - After running, check the `data/` folder. You should see a file named `mcp_message.json` containing the MCP message.

2. **Run `model_b.py`**:
   - This script reads the MCP message from `data/mcp_message.json` and makes a prediction.
   - Run it using:
     ```bash
     python models/model_b.py
     ```
   - You should see the prediction result printed in the terminal.

### Expected Output
- **Output of `model_a.py`**:
  - A JSON file (`data/mcp_message.json`) is created with the preprocessed data and metadata.
  - Example:
    ```json
    {
      "context_id": "txn_12345",
      "model_name": "preprocessing_model",
      "output": {
        "amount": 150.0,
        "currency": "USD",
        "location": "New York",
        "timestamp": "2023-10-01T12:34:56Z"
      },
      "metadata": {
        "data_version": "v1.0",
        "preprocessing_steps": ["uppercase_currency", "clean_location"]
      }
    }
    ```

- **Output of `model_b.py`**:
  - The script reads the MCP message and makes a prediction.
  - Example:
    ```json
    {
      "context_id": "txn_12345",
      "model_name": "fraud_prediction_model",
      "output": {
        "is_fraud": true
      },
      "metadata": {
        "model_version": "v1.0",
        "prediction_threshold": 100.0
      }
    }
    ```

### Troubleshooting
- If you encounter errors, ensure that:
  - Python is installed correctly.
  - You are in the correct project directory (`mcp-demo-ref`).
  - The `data/` folder exists and is writable.
